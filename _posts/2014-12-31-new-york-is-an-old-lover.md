New York is an old lover. Every year or so you meet up for coffee and trade stories. You promised yourself you were done with this, and yet here you are again. He tells you that he likes your hair - the pink streak reminds him of summer.

You have new lovers now. You’re happier than you were back then. Neither of you say it, but you’re trying to tease out those feelings that you once shared. It’s no more than wanting to taste that again - you both know those days are over. As pleasant as the memories are, they’re made bittersweet by the pain you’ll forever associate with the other from that long and difficult breakup.
